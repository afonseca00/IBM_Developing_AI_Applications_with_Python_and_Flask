## Course Overview
This repository contains the materials and projects completed during the IBM course "Developing AI Applications with Python and Flask". The course focuses on building AI-based web applications using various technologies and libraries.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Watson NLP
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Git

## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Introduction to Python and AI
In this lab, we explored the basics of Python programming and its applications in AI. We covered fundamental concepts and wrote simple Python scripts to get familiar with the language.

### Lab 2: Exploring Watson NLP
This lab introduced us to the Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP) library. We learned how to use Watson NLP for sentiment analysis and emotion detection.

### Lab 3: Building a Flask Web Application
We built a basic web application using Flask. This lab covered the fundamentals of creating routes, rendering templates, and handling user input.

### Lab 4: Integrating AI into Flask
In this lab, we integrated the Watson NLP library into our Flask application. We developed a simple interface to analyze text input and display the results.

### Lab 5: Formatting and Packaging the Application
We learned how to format the output of our application and package it for distribution. This included creating a setup script and organizing the project structure.

### Lab 6: Unit Testing
We wrote unit tests for our application to ensure its functionality and reliability. This lab covered the basics of writing tests and using the unittest framework.

### Lab 7: Deploying the Application
This lab focused on deploying our Flask application to a web server. We learned how to configure the server and deploy the application to a live environment.

### Lab 8: Error Handling and Code Analysis
We incorporated error handling into our application to manage invalid input gracefully. Additionally, we ran static code analysis to ensure our code adheres to PEP8 guidelines.

## Practice Project
In the Practice Project, we applied the knowledge gained from the labs to build a more comprehensive AI-based application. This project involved creating an advanced emotion detection system and deploying it as a web application.

## Final Project: AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment

### Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.

### Introduction
In this final project, you will be assessed on the knowledge gained on all aspects of app creation and its web deployment throughout this course. You will be required to save screenshots of your results from time to time, with specific nomenclature. These screenshots will have to be uploaded in the peer-graded assignment that follows.

In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.

Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting the finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and so on, from statements rather than the simple polarity that sentiment analysis provides. This makes emotion detection a very important branch of study and businesses use such systems widely for their AI-based recommendation systems, automated chat bots, and so on.

### Project Guidelines
For the completion of this project, you'll have to complete the following 8 tasks, based on the knowledge you have gained through the course.

**Note:** This platform is not persistent. It is recommended that you keep a copy of your code on your local machines and save changes from time to time. In case you revisit the lab, you will need to recreate the files in this lab environment, using the saved copies from your machines.

### Tasks and Objectives
1. **Fork and Clone the project repository**
2. **Create an emotion detection application using Watson NLP library**
3. **Format the output of the application**
4. **Package the application**
