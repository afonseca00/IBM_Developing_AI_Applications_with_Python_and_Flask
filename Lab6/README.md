# Lab 6: Building an API with Flask: Route Creation, Error Handling, and HTTP Requests

Welcome to part 2 of the Flask lab. In this lab, I worked with HTTP routes and requests. I practiced creating a small RESTful API. I handled errors at the application level for common errors like:

- 404 NOT FOUND
- 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR

## Learning Objectives

- Write routes to process requests to the Flask server at specific URLs
- Handle parameters and arguments sent to the URLs
- Write error handlers for server and user errors
